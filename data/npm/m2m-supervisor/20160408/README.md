## Overview
[`m2m-supervisor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/m2m-supervisor) contains a set of processes that can run on an embedded processing platform.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
There is no fix version for `m2m-supervisor`.
