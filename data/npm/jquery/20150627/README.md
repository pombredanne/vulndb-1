## Overview
[`jquery`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery) is JavaScript library for DOM operations.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when a cross-domain ajax request is performed without the `dataType` option causing `text/javascript` responses to be executed.

## Remediation
Upgrade `jquery` to version `3.0.0` or higher.
