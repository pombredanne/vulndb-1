## Overview
[`select2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/select2) is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
 The `escapeMarkup` function escaped only &, and not html tags, quotes or slashes.
You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `select2` to version 3.3.0 or higher.
