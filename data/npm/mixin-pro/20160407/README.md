## Overview
[`mixin-pro`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mixin-pro) is a Javascript multi-inheritance with mixin for code reuse.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
Upgrade `mixin-pro` to version 0.6.7 or higher.
