## Overview
[`datatables`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/datatables) enhances HTML tables with the ability to sort, filter and page the data in the table very easily.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `datatables` to version 1.10.10 or higher.
