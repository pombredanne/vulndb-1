## Overview
[`microservicebus.node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microservicebus.node) is an integration platform for IoT and enterprise applications.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
Upgrade `microservicebus.node` to version 0.4.3 or higher.
