## Overview
[`actionhero`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/actionhero) is a multi-transport API Server with integrated cluster capabilities and delayed tasks.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal attacks.
`actionhero` would reference and send files from private directories, allowing an attacker to possibly retrieve information from these restricted private directories.

## Remediation
Upgrade `actionhero` to version 4.0.0 or higher.
