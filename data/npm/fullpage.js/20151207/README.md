## Overview
[`fullpage.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullpage.js) is a package to help fullscreen scrolling websites.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The `fullpage.js` package used code from an older jquery library that contained the vulnerable `location.hash()` function. It was used to select elements, but also allows remote attackers to inject script into the page.

This is related to a vulnerability in the [jQuery](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery:20110606) and the [jQuery-migrate](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery-migrate:20130419) packages.
You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `fullpage.js` to version 2.7.6 or higher.
