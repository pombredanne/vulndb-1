## Overview
[`growl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/growl) is a package adding Growl support for Nodejs.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
Upgrade `growl` to version 1.9.3 or higher.
