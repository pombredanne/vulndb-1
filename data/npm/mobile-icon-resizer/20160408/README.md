## Overview
[`mobile-icon-resizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobile-icon-resizer) is a tool used to resize iOS and Android application icons in batch. 

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject arbitrary commands.

## Remediation
Upgrade `mobile-icon-resizer` to version 0.4.3 or higher.
