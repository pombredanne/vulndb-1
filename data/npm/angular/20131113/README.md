## Overview
[`angular`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular) is an open-source JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, that assists with running single-page applications with the goal of making development and testing easier by augmenting browser-based applications with model–view–controller (MVC) capability.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Protection Bypass via `ng-attr-action` and `ng-attr-srcdoc` allowing binding to Javascript.
The fix was to require bindings to `form[action]` to be `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` and bindings to `iframe[srcdoc]` to be `$sce.HTML`

## Remediation
Upgrade `angular` to version 1.2.2 or higher.
