## Overview
[`sanitize-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html) is a library for scrubbing html input of malicious values.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to unescaped double quotes.

Entering the following:

```html
<IMG SRC= onmouseover="alert('XSS');">
```

produces the following:

```html
<img src="onmouseover="alert('XSS');"" />
```

## Remediation
Upgrade `sanitize-html` to version 1.2.3 or higher.
