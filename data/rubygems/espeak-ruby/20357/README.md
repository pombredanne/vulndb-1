## Overview
[`espeak-ruby`](https://rubygems.org/gems/espeak-ruby) is a small Ruby API for utilizing ‘espeak’ and ‘lame’ to create Text-To-Speech mp3 files.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection and Environment variable disclosure. User input is passed as an argument in the `speak`, `save`, `bytes` or `bytes_wav` methods in `lib/espeak/speech.rb`, allowing a malicious user to run arbitrary code or see environment variables.

## Remediation
Upgrade `espeak-ruby` to version 1.0.3 or higher.
