## Overview
[`haml`](https://rubygems.org/gems/haml) is a layer on top of HTML or XML that's designed to express the structure of documents in an elegant way.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The `haml_concat` does not have it's contents properly escaped, when used in the `haml_tag` block.

You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog](https://snyk.io/blog/marked-xss-vulnerability/).

## Remediation
Upgrade `haml` to version 4.0.5 or higher.
