## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. An attacker could have Puppet execute malicious code by convincing a privileged user to change directories to one containing the malicious code and then run Puppet.

**Note:** On platforms with Ruby 1.9.1 or earlier.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.7.26, 3.6.2 or higher.
