## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via the `resource_type` service. An attacker could cause puppet to load arbitrary Ruby files from the puppet master node’s file system.

**Note:** This behavior is not enabled by default, but could be enabled in the `auth.conf` file.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.7.23, 3.2.4 or higher.
