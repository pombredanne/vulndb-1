## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation die to the unsafe manner puppet uses temp files, allowing attackers to use a symlink attack and cause the puppet agent to overwrite something it did not intend to.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.7.25, 3.4.2 or higher.
