## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution attacks. A malicious user who has access to agent SSL keys and file-creation permission may be able to create a file whose full pathname contains executable commands, then craft a file bucket request to execute these commands on the puppet master.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.15, 2.7.13 or higher.
