## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. It is possible for a malicious attacker to spoof the `puppet` master by inserting the master's DNS alt names into the `Subject Alternative Name` field of the certificate.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.12, 2.7.6 or higher.
