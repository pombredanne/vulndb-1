## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Symlink Attack via a user's `.k5login` file. The k5login type is typically used to manage a file in the home directory of a user. The purpose of this file is to allow access to other users.

The `.k5login` file previously wrote to the target file directly, as root, without doing anything to secure the file. If the `.k5login `file was replaced with a symlink, this would allow the owner of the home directory to replace any file on the system, including the `.k5login` file of a more privileged user, with the “correct” content of their own file.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.11, 2.7.5 or higher.
