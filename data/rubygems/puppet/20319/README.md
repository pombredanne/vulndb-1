## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. Any authenticated client could cause the hosting server to execute arbitrary code in response to a catalog request. A malicious user may specially craft this request to collect sensitive information on the server, by using the `template` or `inline_template` functions.

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.18, 2.7.21, 3.1.1 or higher.
