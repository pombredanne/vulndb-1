## Overview
[`puppet`](https://rubygems.org/gems/puppet) is an automated configuration management tool.
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal when the `auth.conf` file enables deletion. An attacker may craft a Delete request and arbitrarily delete files on the puppet master and potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Remediation
Upgrade `puppet` to version 2.6.17, 2.7.18 or higher.
