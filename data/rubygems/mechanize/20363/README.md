## Overview
[`mechanize`](https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/mechanize.json) is used for automating interaction with websites.

Affected versions of the package exposed the http authentication credentials. Only one set of HTTP authentication credentials were allowed for a connections. If a mechanize instance connected to more than one server then a malicious server detecting mechanize could ask for HTTP Basic authentication. This would expose the username and password intended only for one server.

## Remediation
Upgrade `mechanize` to version 2.4 or higher.
