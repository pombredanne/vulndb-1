## Overview
[`actionpack`](https://rubygems.org/gems/actionpack) is a web app builder and tester on Rails.
The template selection code contains a vulnerability which allows an attacker to craft a URL and cause Rails to render an arbitrary view, regardless of if they have permissions to view the template. This only affects 3.0 applications which use `:action` in their routes.
