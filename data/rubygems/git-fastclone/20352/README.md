## Overview
[`git-fastclone`](https://rubygems.org/gems/git-fastclone) is a git command that uses reference repositories and threading to quickly and recursively clone repositories with many nested submodules.

## Details
git-fastclone before 1.0.5 passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell command. An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the strings that are passed as arguments to `cd` and `git clone` commands in the library.

## Remediation
Upgrade to version `1.0.5` or greater.
