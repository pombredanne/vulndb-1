## Overview
[`psych`](https://rubygems.org/gems/psych) is a YAML parser and emitter. Psych leverages [libyaml](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) for its YAML parsing and emitting capabilities.

Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker could cause the server to crash by making the `scanner.c` file parse a newline character (`\n`).

## Remediation
Upgrade `psych` to version 2.0.13 or higher.
