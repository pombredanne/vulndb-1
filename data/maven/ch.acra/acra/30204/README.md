## Overview
[`ch.acra:acra`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22acra%22) publishes a report of an Android application crash to Google docs (or some other end point).
The ACRA library for Android does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
