## Overview
[`com.thoughtworks.xstream:xstream`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22xstream%22)
XStream through 1.4.9, when a certain denyTypes workaround is not used, mishandles attempts to create an instance of the primitive type 'void' during unmarshalling, leading to a remote application crash, as demonstrated by an `xstream.fromXML("&lt;void/>")` call.
