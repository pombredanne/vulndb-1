## Overview
[`com.opensymphony:xwork-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22xwork-core%22) is an command-pattern framework that is used to power WebWork as well as other applications. XWork provides an Inversion of Control container, a powerful expression language, data type conversion, validation, and pluggable configuration.

The CookieInterceptor component in Apache Struts before 2.3.1.1 does not use the parameter-name whitelist, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted HTTP Cookie header that triggers Java code execution through a static method.
