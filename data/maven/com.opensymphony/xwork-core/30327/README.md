## Overview
[`com.opensymphony:xwork-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22xwork-core%22)  is an command-pattern framework that is used to power WebWork as well as other applications. XWork provides an Inversion of Control container, a powerful expression language, data type conversion, validation, and pluggable configuration.

Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long parameter name, which is processed as an OGNL expression.
