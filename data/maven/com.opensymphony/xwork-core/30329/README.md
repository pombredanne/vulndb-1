## Overview
[`com.opensymphony:xwork-core`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22xwork-core%22) is an command-pattern framework that is used to power WebWork as well as other applications. XWork provides an Inversion of Control container, a powerful expression language, data type conversion, validation, and pluggable configuration.

Apache Struts 2 before 2.3.14.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL code via a request with a crafted value that contains both "${}" and "%{}" sequences, which causes the OGNL code to be evaluated twice.
