## Overview
[`org.apache.camel:camel-core`](https://camel.apache.org/) is a versatile open-source integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.
The Validation Component of Apache Camel evaluates DTD headers of XML stream sources, although a validation against XML schemas (XSD) is executed. Remote attackers can use this feature to make Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by sending XML documents with remote DTDs URLs or XML External Entities (XXE).  The vulnerability is not given for SAX or StAX sources.

## Remediation
Upgrade `org.apache.camel:camel-core` to version 2.17.6, 2.18.3 or higher.
