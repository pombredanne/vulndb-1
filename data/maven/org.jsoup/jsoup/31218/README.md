## Overview
[`org.jsoup:jsoup`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22jsoup%22)
Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks which occurred due to of improperly handling tags
without a closing `>` when reaching EOF.

##Details
JSoup did not properly validate user-supplied HTML content. Certain HTML snippets could get past the validator without being detected as unsafe. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted HTML snippet to execute arbitrary web script in the user's browser.
