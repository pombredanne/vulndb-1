## Overview
[`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-coyote`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22tomcat-coyote%22)
In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for a `WINDOW_UPDATE` before allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.
