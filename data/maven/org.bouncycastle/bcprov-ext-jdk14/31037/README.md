## Overview
[`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14`](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22bcprov-ext-jdk14%22)
The TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
